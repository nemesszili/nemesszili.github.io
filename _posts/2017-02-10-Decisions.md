With the conclusion of my fifth semester in Computer Science, I have come to realize that the Masterplanâ„¢ cannot be delayed any longer: __to arms!__ I mean, __to keyboard!__

Spirits high? Check.<br>
Full cup of tea? Check.<br>
Glasses on? Check.<br>
Charger in? Check.<br>
OS booted? Check.<br>
Feeling confident about the future? Damn.<br><br>

### What's the plan?

I hope I am right in assuming that the majority of freshly graduated students faces the career dilemma, a.k.a. become a fully functional adult overnight. Of course, there are the geniuses and fortunate sons who already got everything figured out - or someone else has their destiny set in stone.

But they are not today's audience. Just kidding, guys, stick around, you're way smarter than me, you might spot a mistake or two.

So let's start with what we know: at the end of your bachelor studies the first decision you have to make is whether continue studying or start looking for work. 

1. Keep studying (masters)
	* **Pro**: have a better understanding of your field and get a higher salary upon graduation
	* **Con**: 2+ years of weekly assignments and tests
2. Look for work
	* **Pro**: get to know your areas of interest + extra cash
	* **Con**: 40 hrs/week at the office. For the next 45 years.

In case you're wondering how on earth does having a job help you get to know your interests more than staying in college: the bachelor studies here are quite _dense_ - you get to finish 4 years worth of material in 3 years. Time for hobbies mid-semester? Forget about it. Time to mess around with stuff that might advance your career one day? You must be joking. Do I have the wrong attitude about my studies if I don't enjoy this much content? Possibly.

Moving on, let's add another dimension to the issue above - you also have the option to move abroad.

1. Stay home:
	* **Pro**: keep your social network and the place you're staying at
	* **Con**: the feeling that you're not making an impact large enough
2. Move abroad:
	* **Pro**: you are definitely building your future out here/making serious money and you get to talk in English everywhere
	* **Con**: you sometimes miss the old environment and the word jokes you could make in Hungarian

Combined, that makes a total of four options:

1. Move abroad + keep studying
2. Move abroad + look for work
3. Stay home + keep studying
4. Stay home + look for work

### What to choose?

If you know your true calling and you know precisely what inspires you, a masters program might be in order. It does deepen your knowledge of the field you fancy, especially if you are guided by the right people. Most of the time, you will find this environment somewhere abroad: _option number 1_. However, I believe that doing a masters solely for the sake of having a degree may be counterproductive, especially if you do it abroad and you need to make an extra effort to support yourself financially.

In case you haven't the vaguest what interests you and you no longer have an appetite for doing weekly assignments and study for tests, you might be more interested in _options number 2 and 4_.

Now, if you want to be able to tell the difference between option 2 and 4, you need to see the difference clearly. In [numbers](It-figures.html), that is.
